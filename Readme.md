## üìå What is Cairo?
[Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/) is a **Turing-complete programming language** designed for writing **provable programs**.  
It is the core language used to build **scalable and verifiable applications** on blockchain networks. Cairo allows developers to write programs that can be verified using **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**, making it a foundational technology for **scalability** in the blockchain ecosystem.

Key points:
- Built for **validity proofs** and **STARKs** (Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge).
- Used to write **smart contracts** on StarkNet.
- Provides **low-level control** while supporting higher-level abstractions.

## üåå What is StarkNet?
[StarkNet](https://starknet.io/) is a **Layer 2 scaling solution** for Ethereum, built using Cairo.  
It leverages **zk-Rollup technology** based on STARKs to achieve:
- **Scalability**: Thousands of transactions per second with low fees.
- **Security**: Inherits Ethereum‚Äôs security through validity proofs.
- **Decentralization**: Anyone can deploy contracts and interact permissionlessly.

In short, **Cairo is the programming language**, while **StarkNet is the network** where Cairo smart contracts live.

## üó∫Ô∏è Architecture Overview

**Architecture relationship between Ethereum, StarkNet, and Cairo:**

- **Ethereum (Layer 1)** ‚Üí Provides the base security layer.
- **StarkNet (Layer 2)** ‚Üí A zk-Rollup built on top of Ethereum, using STARK proofs to scale transactions.
- **Cairo** ‚Üí The programming language used to write smart contracts on StarkNet.
- **Applications** ‚Üí DeFi protocols, NFTs, and various dApps are deployed on StarkNet using Cairo.
